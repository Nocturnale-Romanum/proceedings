# Major editorial guidelines

## Calendar / Rubrics set

(Matthias) Sandhofe uses 1954 rubrics and gives in appendix the 1960 calendar, new feasts (1954-1960), and the Novus Ordo psalter schema for Officium Lectionis.
(Matthias) I think we should stick with this, but add S. Joseph Opificis and S. Maria Regina in the main book, and give both calendars at the incipit (where a calendar normally is).
(Matthias) In any case, printing only what is necessary for 1960 rubrics would be a net loss of patrimony.

## Square notes neumatic schema

(Matthias) This question is about whether square notes should reflect only the melody (as is done in Vatican Editions and even in Graduale Novum for the most part), or if they should reflect the neumes as well.
(Matthias) Here are some detailed questions.

### Scandicus square notation

(Matthias) fg!h or FGh ?

Steering committee decision: TODO

### Oriscus square notation

(Matthias) f or fo ?

Steering committee decision: TODO

... etc

## Rhythmic signs

(Matthias) It could be interesting to report episemas from the neumes onto the square notes, especially if decision is made to not have a duplex edition.

Steering committee decision: TODO

## Ancient neumes

(Matthias) Questions regarding whether or not we should include ancient neumes and how

### Inclusion of ancient neumes

(Matthias) Should we prepare a book without ancient neumes ? With them ? Two books ?
(Matthias) It should be noted that once we have a book with ancient neumes, producing the book without them is very easy to do automatically.

### Choice of manuscripts

(Matthias) Manuscripts used by Sandhofe are probably the best way. Are there others ? Should some of them be eliminated ?

### Inclusion of ancient neumes on new pieces

(Matthias) Should ancient neumes be used on pieces that re-use the melody with other lyrics? If so, should the now incorrect liquescences be corrected?

## New pieces

(Matthias) What guidelines should be given for the composition of new pieces?
(Matthias) Options: reusing HPS pieces ; only reusing ancient melodies ; designating a composition group for composing new pieces.

Steering committee decision: TODO

## Melodic corrections to Sandhofe / Other plainchant sources

(Matthias) This is about if we change melodies and which

### Melodic corrections to pieces that already have an official restitution

(Matthias) some pieces already have official restitutions: Tenebrae, Christmas Matins, Responsoria Prolixa for 1st vespers OSB, and a few more. Are we allowed to correct them?

Steering committee decision: TODO

### Melodic corrections of the Si/Sib

(Matthias) Should we correct Si/Sib ?

Steering committee decision: TODO

### Melodic correction of the Si/Do

(Matthias) Should we correct Do recitating chord to Si in 3rd mode pieces?

Steering committee decision: TODO

### Format

(Matthias) Should we have several formats in mind or only the hand-held one (e.g. Solesmes recent books) ? Should we anticipate a Lutrin version ?

### Color

(Matthias) Should we anticipate the possibility of red ink, or only black ?
